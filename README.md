# Hi There! I'm Asher Gates ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young app/web developer that really likes learning about code.
As you can probably tell, I'm somewhat new at the whole process, but one thing
about me is that I like to learn as I go. At the moment I'm learning
SwiftUI on my iPad with the [Swift Playgrounds App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492), and it's made me
realize how badly we need [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on iPads. Anyways, that's enough about
me, you should go get back to writing your own story. ðŸ˜„
