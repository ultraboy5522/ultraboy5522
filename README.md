# Hey! I'm Asher Gates 👋

I'm a young app/web developer that really likes learning about code.
As you can probably tell, I'm new at the whole process, but one thing
about me is that I like to learn as I go. At the moment I'm learning
SwiftUI on my iPad with the Swift Playgrounds app, and it's made me
realize how badly we need Xcode on iPads. Anyways, that's enough about
me, you should go get back to writing your own story. :)
