# Hi There! I'm Asher Gates ðŸ‘‹

I'm a young app/web developer that really likes learning about code.
As you can probably tell, I'm somewhat new at the whole process, but one thing
about me is that I like to learn as I go. At the moment I'm learning
SwiftUI on my iPad with the [Swift Playgrounds App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492), and it's made me
realize how badly we need [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) on iPads. Anyways, that's enough about
me, you should go get back to writing your own story. ðŸ˜„

# Some Inspirational Quotes I found 
These are some quotes I found having to do with code that I thought were cool:

> The most dangerous phrase in the language is, â€˜Weâ€™ve always done it this way.' â€“ Grace Hopper

It's always important to keep your mind open to other ways of doing something!

> Programming isnâ€™t about what you know; itâ€™s about what you can figure out. â€“ Chris Pine

This is one thing I really like about programming: It's pushing buttons and having fun! (with maybe just a little learning too)

> You might not think that programmers are artists, but programming is an extremely creative profession. Itâ€™s logic-based creativity. â€“ John Romero

This is really true! I think of a blank file like an empty canvas, ready to be filled with ideas, and when it's finished it can be absolutely anything at all!
Anyway, I hope these quotes inspire you in the same way they inspire me, to keep coding, and have a good time! ðŸ˜‰
